***BioPortainer Workbench*** is an open-source software developed under the MIT license and designed in a modular way, aimed at facilitating user interaction with Docker environments in three different computational layers: (i) infrastructure, (ii) platform and (iii) application. Its basic structure is briefly described in Figure 1. To deploy the software, user must initially access the ***BioPortainer Workbench*** image (Figure 1b) and install it, either in a single Docker engine, or in a Swarm cluster (Figure 1c). Once installed, ***BioPortainer Workbench*** (Figure 1d) consists of two basic containers: the ***BioPortainer Panel*** and the ***BioPortainer Pipeline Runner*** (Figure 1e). From a functional point of view (Figure 1f), the two containers offer a number of tools that allow users to perform a series of actions in the created Docker environmens, such as: (i) managing Docker resources associated with the ***BioPortainer Workbench***; (ii) installing bioinformatics applications based on several platforms described in the literature and (iii) launching different types of analyses, using either command-line (CLI), or graphic-based interfaces (GUI). Such analyses may be conducted with the help of ***BioPortainer Workbench's*** own resources (Figure 1g), or with resources harnessed from external repositories which provide preconfigured images, files, commands or scripts for the execution of bioinformatics software, with varying levels complexity (Figure 1h).
